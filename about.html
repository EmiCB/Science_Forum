				<p>Our science project is centered on the Falcon 9 reusable rocket. As described in the "The Problem" section below, we are atempting to solve the problems the craft has in landing reliably.</p>
				<p>We have tried multiple approaches to modeling the rocket and its crashes. Some of our team worked on 3D models of the landing legs, attempting to improve the design there. Others used Kerbal Space Program to attempt to model landing and the landing legs.</p>
				<p>The 3D modeling team made landing legs and an attachment system for those legs, trying to make the rocket more stable on landing.</p>
				
				<h2>The Problem</h2>
				<p>The problem that we are currently facing is that the Falcon 9 does not land upright. This results in millions of dollars being wasted on building rockets. The Falcon 9 was built to be reusable, but since only two of the five attempts have been successful, it setbacks reusable rocket technology. We believe that having more people working on the same problem will result in fewer failures and less money wasted. You can watch one of the rocket crashes in the video below.</p>
