		<p style="text-index: 40px"> Our science project centers on the Falcon 9 reusable rocket. As described on the "Problem" page, we are atempting to solve the problems the craft has in landing reliably. <br>
		We have tried multiple approaches to modeling the rocket and its crashes. Some of our team worked on 3D models of the landing legs, attempting to improve the design there. Others used Kerbal Space Program to attempt to model landing and the landing legs. <br>
		The 3D modeling team made landing legs and an attachment system for those legs, trying to make the rocket more stable on landing.
