				<p>The problem that we are currently facing is that the Falcon 9 does not land upright. This results in millions of dollars being wasted on building rockets. The Falcon 9 was built to be reusable, but since only two of the five attempts have been successful, it setbacks reusable rocket technology. We believe that having more people working on the same problem will result in fewer failures and less money wasted. You can watch one of the rocket crashes in the video below.</p>
