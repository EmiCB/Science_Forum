				<p>To solve the problem that we have defined on the about page, we have created a model of the Falcon 9 in Kerbal Space Program. We have also cadded some models and designs in tinkercad. Any videos or photos of sucess in our project will be posted below as well as the steps that we have taken to solve this problem as best we can.</p>
