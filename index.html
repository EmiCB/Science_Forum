				<p>Welcome to our website! Here we will describe what we have done to help the Falcon 9. We are five students from a laboratory high school who have decided to try to help fix the Falcon 9 crash  problem this semester in science class. We aren't rocket scientists, so we would like any ideas or feedback you can provide to help the Falcon 9's landing process. We have already modeled many landing leg designs and different ideas for landing mechanisms through 3D printing. Any help would be appreciated, and we are willing to work with others to solve this problem. We would love it if some experts or even regular people who are interested in the topic could comment on our forum page and share any ideas that they have with us and others.</p>
